<p>
Hello there! I'm DeShane Sims, a passionate web tester and SEO specialist with a keen eye for detail and a commitment to ensuring high-quality digital experiences. With 5 years of experience in software testing, I've had the pleasure of working on a wide range of web applications, ensuring they are not only functional but also optimized for search engines and user experience.  <br>

My journey into the world of web testing and SEO began with a deep curiosity about how websites work, behind the scenes—from performance and security to accessibility and visibility in search rankings. <br> Over the years, I've honed my skills in Selenium, Jira, TestMO, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UX/UI, and SEO best practices, continuously refining my approach to testing and optimization.  

What sets me apart is my dedication to not just finding bugs but enhancing overall website performance. <br> I believe that a great website isn’t just error-free—it should also be fast, accessible, and search-engine-friendly. Whether I’m testing functionalities, analyzing page speed, or improving on-page SEO, I always strive to deliver results that improve both user experience and search rankings. <br> 

Outside of testing, you’ll often find me exploring new SEO strategies, experimenting with automation tools, or keeping up with the latest Google algorithm updates. I’m a firm believer in continuous learning and collaboration, always eager to share insights and improve my expertise.  

I’m currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my web testing and SEO skills in a dynamic and innovative environment. <br> If you're looking for a detail-oriented tester who is passionate about website quality and visibility, I'd love to chat!  

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I’ve worked on, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect. Let’s build something amazing together!
